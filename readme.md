# DevanagariDvorak.keylayout for Mac OS X

This keyboard layout provides a Devanagari Dvorak keyboard layout
that provides extended Unicode characters and modifier keys similar to
the Dvorak keyboard layout shipped with OS X.

Beginning with version 10.2 (Jaguar), Mac OS X started supporting the
[XML-based format for keyboard layouts (.keylayout files)][2] which is
provided here, and OS X 10.5 (Leopard) discontinued support for the
old Keyboard Suitcase (resource file) keyboard layout format.



## Installation

1. Download `DevanagariDvorak.keylayout`.
2. Move the file to `/Library/Keyboard Layouts`.
3. Restart the computer.
4. Open System Preferences,
    go to Language & Text,
    then Input Sources, and
    tick Devanagari Dvorak in the list of input methods.
5. Check "Show input menu in menu bar" to change keyboard layout
    from the menu bar.
6. To use the keyboard layout on the login screen,
    open System Preferences, go to Accounts, then Login Options and
    select "Show input menu in login window".



## Rearranging the keyboard

Recent Apple keyboards are easy to rearrange: Lift each key from the
left corner until it snaps, then slide it carefully to the right to
free it from the holding mechanism. You'll need a thin tool to lift
this up to attach the key in its new location. Once attached on the
right, press until it clicks in. You don't need to move the A and M keys.
